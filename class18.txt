Create a calculator which asks for the inputs from user and performs one of the following operations on them as per user's choice:
Calculate sum 
Calculate difference(only positive value)
Calculate quotient
Calculate remainder
Calculate average
Calculate interest for given percentage.


def numCalc(num1, num2):
    su = num1 + num2

    divs = num1 / num2

    prod = num1 * num2
    diff = num1 - num2
    return su, divs, prod, diff
nu1 = int(input("First value"))

nu2 = int(input("Second value"))

res = numCalc(nu1, nu2)
x,y,z,u = numCalc(nu1, nu2)

print("Sum of values entered is ", x)

print("Div of values entered is ", y)

output:
First value 20
Second value 10
Sum of values entered is  30
Div of values entered is  2.0
Prod of values entered is  200
Diff of values entered is  10
